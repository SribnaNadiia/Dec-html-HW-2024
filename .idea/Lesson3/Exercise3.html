    </div>

    <div class="main"><p class="textp">Amenhotep I or Amenophis I  was the second Pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is generally dated from 1526
        to 1506 BC (Low Chronology).
        He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari but had an elder brother, Ahmose-ankh, and was not expected to
        inherit the throne. However, sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I's 17th regnal year and his death, his
        heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince.[7] He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21
        years.[2]
        Although his reign is poorly documented, it is possible to piece together a basic history from available
        evidence. He inherited the kingdom formed by his father's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia
        and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in the Levant. He continued the
        rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his
        mortuary temple, setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom.
        After his death, he was deified as a patron god of Deir el-Medina.[8].</p>

    <div class="header">
        <span class="textspan"><b>Imhotep</b></span>
    </div>

    <div class="main"><p class="textp">Imhotep was an Egyptian chancellor to the King Djoser, possible architect of
        Djoser's step
        pyramid, and high priest of the sun god Ra at Heliopolis. Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical
        figure, but in the 3,000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and deified.
        Traditions from long after Imhotep's death treated him as a great author of wisdom texts[3] and especially as a
        physician. No text from his lifetime mentions these capacities and no text mentions his name in
        the first 1,200 years following his death.[9][10] Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that
        establish him as chancellor to the Pharaoh, the first text to refer to Imhotep dates to the time of Amenhotep
        III . It is addressed to the owner of a tomb and reads:
        The wab-priest may give offerings to your ka. The wab-priests may stretch to you their arms with libations on
        the soil, as it is done for Imhotep with the remains of the water bowl.
        It appears that this libation to Imhotep was done regularly, as they are attested on papyri associated with
        statues of Imhotep until the Late Period . Wildung explains the origin of this cult as
        a slow evolution of intellectuals' memory of Imhotep, from his death onward. Gardiner finds the cult of Imhotep
        during the New Kingdom sufficiently distinct from the usual offerings made to other commoners
        that the epithet "demigod" is likely justified to describe his veneration.

    <div class="header">
        <span class="textspan"><b>Anubis</b></span>
    </div>

    <div class="main"><p class="textp">Anubis , also known as Inpu, Inpw, Jnpw,
        or Anpu in Ancient Egyptian , is the god of funerary rites, protector of
        graves, and guide to the underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a
        canine head.
        Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector
        of graves as early as the First Dynasty, Anubis was also an embalmer. By the Middle
        Kingdom he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent
        roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended the weighing scale during the "Weighing of
        the Heart", in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Anubis is
        one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods in the Egyptian pantheon; however, no relevant myth
        involved him.
        Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the
        discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with Wepwawet, another Egyptian god portrayed
        with a dog's head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were
        eventually combined.[6] Anubis' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.
