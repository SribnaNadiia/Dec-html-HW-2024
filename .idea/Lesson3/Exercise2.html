    <p class="top-text">Films</p>
    <span class="text">A film, also known as a movie or motion picture,[a] is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise
        communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, emotions, or atmosphere through the use of moving images that are generally, #
        since the 1930s, synchronized with sound and (less commonly) other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema" is a shortening of the
        word "cinematography" and is used to refer to either filmmaking, the film industry, the overall art form, or a movie theater.</span>

    <p class="top-text">Cartoon</p>
    <span class="text">A cartoon is a type of visual art that is typically drawn, frequently animated, in an unrealistic or semi-realistic style.
        The specific meaning has evolved, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire,
        caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons
        in the first sense is called a cartoonist,[1] and in the second sense they are usually called an animator.</span>
